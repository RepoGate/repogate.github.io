<h2>Security</h2>

<section>
This page details current security shortcomings in RepoGate. The current
workarounds for these is to avoid exposing RepoGate ports publicly (by using
a firewall, VPN, or only exposing those ports locally), and to only use
RepoGate to protect public repositories.
<h3>Race Conditions</h3>

<section>
RepoGate makes use of tunnelling to gain more control over SCM
primitives. For instance, git clone is tunnelled over a RepoGate
socket. This allows for more control over the connection, and also
allows for adding extra features to the connection, such as adding
transport layer security to SCM connections that don't support it.
However, RepoGate currently uses a naive approach to tunnelling that <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30824344/security-implications-of-a-socket-race-when-tunnelling-a-sub-command">
suffers from a race condition</a>. The result is that, because linux TCP
ports are global to all users, an attacker that has access to a host
running a RepoGate deployment may be able to read repositories that are
being sent through RepoGate connections without requiring elevated
priviledges.
</section>
<h3>No Transport Layer Security</h3>

<section>
Because of the way it was designed (see above), RepoGate can add TLS/SSL
to SCMs that don't currently support it. However, this functionality has
not yet been added, and so communications are not currently encrypted.
</section>
<h3>Deployment Secrets</h3>

<section>
Master passwords for deployments are stored in plaintext in environment
variables in both the HTTP and RepoGate server processes, meaning that
they can be discovered by inspecting the environment variables for these
processes, e.g. via `/proc`. In addition, these are exposed to tests
that are run with this deployment (so that they can retrieve private
data that may be needed for testing), so that any secrets stored by
RepoGate can be discovered by anyone with the ability to run tests in
that instance.
