<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<section>
<h3>Making Team Members More Accountable</h3>

<section>
It is sometimes the case that team members will push code that "works on
my machine", but ultimately breaks the build. This can result in other
team members having to pick up the slack, even when continuous
integration identifies the individual that's responsible. RepoGate
prevents this by rejecting any updates that break the build, meaning
that team members must take the steps to fix their code before they can
push those changes.
</section>
<h3>For Teams With High Inertia</h3>

<section>
<p>
Different teams have different priorities, and it can often be difficult
to keep up with the latest trends such as code review, continuous
integration, or even using the latest tooling such as Git, which all
require buy-in from all team members. RepoGate works around this in a
number of ways.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to Git and existing continuous integration tools, RepoGate
is designed to adapt to your existing workflow and tooling, meaning a
lower barrier to entry. Furthermore, it can prevent team members from
pushing breaking code, so team members are forced to fix their code
before they push it, avoiding the situation that sometimes arises with
continuous integration where the build breaks but the team doesn't stop
to fix it.
</p>
</section>
<h3>For Solo Developers</h3>

<section>
When you're working on your own projects it can be frustrating when code
you tested locally breaks when it's pushed, even because of something as
simple as forgetting to commit a file. RepoGate lets you appease the
perfectionist in you, and keep your builds green.
</section>
<h3>For Managing Outsourced Development</h3>

<section>
Managing an outsourced development team can pose many challenges. Team
members can change without warning and need to be trained, code reviews
need to be performed frequently to keep the standard of code quality up,
and the responsibility of delivering the result often rests on one
person. By making sure that only code that builds and passes tests
actually makes it into the central codebase, repogate can be use to
minimise the risks associated with managing teams. Furthermore, help
messages and links to documentation and training material can be
integrated into the response delivered back the development team, which
means that less time needs to be spent on code reviews and retraining.
</section>
<h3>For Security</h3>

<section>
There have been many cases of private keys and passwords being pushed to
public repositories. With RepoGate you can run checks for things like
SSH keys and suspicious-looking password variables, and prevent such
secrets from making their way into to the central repository in the
first place, instead of having to scrub and rotate the secrets after the
fact.
