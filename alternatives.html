<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>

<section>
The main problem that RepoGate tries to solve is "breaking the build".
This is often solved by using continuous integration (testing the
codebase after changes have been received) in combination with different
workflows and utilities. GitFlow is probably the most widely-known
workflow, and Git "mirror" repositories are used to merge non-breaking
changes from a working copy of the repository to the mainline. While
this functionally achieves the same result as RepoGate, there is a lot
of overhead to this approach in terms of setup and complexity, and
requires buy-in from all team members to adopt the new workflows, and
perhaps tooling if Git isn't already being used. Furthermore, RepoGate
can simplify workflows by allowing "dev"-type branches to be ignored.

<h3>Homu, Bors and Jenkins Pretested Integration</h3>

<section>
Pretested integration is a methodology where merges of Git branches are
tested before they're committed. This is useful because even if the
heads of branches aren't broken, merging them can cause failures, so
pretested integration is used to prevent this. Pretested integration is
orthogonal to RepoGate's pre-commit testing.
