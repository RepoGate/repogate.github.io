<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>

<section>
The main problem that RepoGate tries to solve is "breaking the build".
This is often solved by using continuous integration (testing the
codebase after changes have been received) in combination with different
workflows and utilities. 
<h4>GitFlow, GitHub Flow and Other Git Workflows</h4>

<section>
GitFlow and GitHub Flow are probably the most widely-known Git-based
workflows. These can be used with Git "mirror" repositories to merge
non-breaking changes from a working copy of the repository to the
mainline. While this functionally achieves the same result as
RepoGate, there is a lot of overhead to this approach in terms of
setup and complexity, and requires buy-in from all team members to
adopt the new workflows, and perhaps tooling if Git isn't already
being used. Furthermore, RepoGate can simplify workflows by allowing
"dev"-type branches to be ignored.
</section>
<h4>Travis CI, Circle CI and Other CI Solutions</h4>

<section>
Generally speaking, RepoGate performs the same testing as other CI
tools, but performs that testing before changes are committed,
instead of after. While the use of RepoGate and other CI tools is
orthogonal, using RepoGate will often make the testing portion of a
CI pipeline redundant - when you're using RepoGate your CI test
results should always be "green".

<h3>Homu, Bors and Jenkins Pretested Integration</h3>

<section>
Pretested integration is a methodology where merges of Git branches are
tested before they're committed. This is useful because even if the
heads of branches aren't broken, merging them can cause failures, so
pretested integration is used to prevent this. Pretested integration is
orthogonal to RepoGate's pre-commit testing.
