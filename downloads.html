<p class="warning">
RepoGate currently has security shortcomings and so should not be public
facing, and should only be used to protect public repositories. See the
<a href="security.html">Security</a> page for more details.
</p>
</section>
<h3>Early Shortcomings</h3>

<section>
<p>
RepoGate can't currently handle projects with non-alphanumeric
characters in the name, and can only handle committing to the "master"
branch.
</p>
<p>
RepoGate only supports Git repositories at present, but other SCMs may
be supported if there is interest.
</p>
</section>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<section>
Deploying directly to a repository hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket is
not yet supported by RepoGate. Instead, a RepoGate deployment must be
set up to act as a proxy for the hosted repository. There is a
<a href="https://github.com/repogate/deploy">guide</a> for setting up a
local RepoGate deployment, but the easiest way to get started is to run
the "all-in-one" Docker deployment.
</section>
<h3>"All-in-one" Docker Deployment</h3>

<section>
<p>
This deployment requires Docker and Git to be installed locally. Use the
following command to start the deployment:
</p>
<pre>
docker run -ti --name=repogate.allinone \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-p 127.0.0.1:9418:9418 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repogate/allinone
</pre>
<p>
This will start an all-in-one RepoGate deployment that provides a
"read-only" Git service, a RepoGate service, and a minimal HTTP
interface. It's important to use <code>127.0.0.1</code> as the local
interface for now for security reasons (see <a
href="security.html">Security</a> for details). You will be asked for a
master password that will be used to secure repository passwords. There
will be no output once you've given a password; all the services start
and output from the HTTP server is forwarded to the host. you can now
navigate to <a href="https://localhost:8080">https://localhost:8080</a>
to access the minimal deployment interface.
</p>
<p>
Add a project by entering the
<a href="https://localhost:18080/projects">Projects</a> page and
selecting <a href="https://localhost:18080/projects/add">Add</a>. Here
you enter the details required by RepoGate to retrieve a project from a
hosting service. Enter the username and password you use for the
service, followed by the components of the project's address, and then
submit. There is currently no error handling in the minimal interface;
errors encountered while retrieving the repository will result in a
server error and the project will have to be removed from the
<a href="https://localhost:18080/projects">Projects</a> page (by
entering the project and selecting `Delete`) before trying again. On
success, you should be taken to the project screen for your new project
and shown the `Logs` and `Delete` options. You may now clone and push to
your project.
</p>
<p>
You can clone your project from the all-in-one deployment, which
contains a mirror of your project (don't supply a <code>.git</code>
suffix):
</p>
<pre>
git clone git://localhost/&lt;project-name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Initialise the repository for use with RepoGate using the
<code>rg_init</code> script:
</p>
<pre>
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/repogate/deploy/master/scripts/rg_init.sh \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initialised RepoGate"
</pre>
<p>
<code>.rg/test</code>, which is added to your project when it's
initialised, may contain a single-line bash command line that will be
run as a test when pushing the project. Note that it currently uses the
local environment to run tests in, so if the "all-in-one" Docker
deployment is being used then only the limited number of commands
available in that container can be used. The current workaround is to
use <code>docker exec -it -u root repogate.allinone bash</code> to start
a shell in the container and <code>apt-get</code> any required
dependencies.
</p>
You can now push the project once it has been initialised.  Download the
above binary (<code>frg</code> is the Friendly RepoGate interface to
RepoGate), add it to your <code>PATH</code>, and push your project:
</p>
<pre>
frg push --wall=127.0.0.1:9000 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--proj=&lt;project-name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The test in <code>.rg/test</code> will run in the environment, and the
output will be streamed to the client. If the test fails then the
changes will not be pushed, but on success they will be committed to the
mirror repository in the deployment, and then forwarded on to the
original hosted repository.
</p>
<p>
Log files for the Git daemon, the RepoGate services, and the HTTP server
are reachable from the home screen of the HTTP interface.
