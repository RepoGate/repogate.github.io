<h2>Benefits</h2>

<section>
<h3>Monitor Project Milestones</h3>

<section>
Broken code makes it difficult to see whether a project is progressing
as expected. Even if updates are being made on a consistent basis you
need to be able to run your code to ensure that everything is working as
it should. Repogate allows project managers to keep their finger on the
pulse by protecting the codebase from obvious problems.
</section>
<h3>Avoid Build Breaks</h3>

<section>
Code that "works on my machine" often fails when it makes it to other
programmers on the team, which can cripple productivity and prevent
developers from hitting deadlines. Repogate stops disruptive updates
from making it into the mainline, and gives developers the opportunity
to fix their changes and avoid the embarrassment of breaking the
codebase.
</section>
<h3>Prevent Downtime</h3>

<section>
Like continuous integration, repogate runs your tests before your
website is updated so that errant changes don't bring your whole system
down.
</section>
<h3>Keep Codebases Healthy</h3>

<section>
The "broken window theory" is often applied to software, and many
programmers have experienced the difficulty in making changes to a badly
maintained codebase. Repogate allows you to impose a standard of quality
in your code using any linters or code analysers you like.
